# PIZZA-GRAPHQL-DEMO

## Requirements
- NodeJS

## Local Installation of Server
```
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
Go to the graphql playground - `localhost:3001/graphql`.

## Instructions
- The information about API you can check in the documentation in the graphql playground. 
- Keep in mind that all orders are written in the orders file. You can clean it up by keeping an empty array (only array!).
- Images are provided with `../pizza-graphql-backend/images/...` path so it's recommended to keep this server repo on the same level as the client app.
